# NodeJS-rTorrent
we are looking for developers, please fork and tell us what you want to code and submit pull requests when done

nodejs-rtorrent was created as a web gui for rtorrent. I wanted to create an alternative to rutorrent that used nodejs and this is the how far I got. The technologies used are NodeJS, Express, Handlebars, MongoDB, Mongoose, XMLRPC, FeedMe, Q (Promises), Passport, Socket.IO. For the front-end, I am using AngularJS, RequireJS, Bower, Underscore, and Twitter Bootstrap.
