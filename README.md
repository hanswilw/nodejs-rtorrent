# NodeJS-rTorrent
We are looking for developers, please fork and tell us what you want to code and submit pull requests when done. We are active on our IRC channel [#NodeJS-rTorrent @ Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=nodejs-rtorrent).

Nodejs-rtorrent was created as a web gui for rtorrent. I wanted to create an alternative to rutorrent that used NodeJS and this is the how far I got. The technologies used are NodeJS, Express, MongoDB/TingoDB, Mongoose, tungus (for use with Mongoose), XML-RPC, FeedMe, Q (Promises), Passport, and Socket.IO. For the front-end, I am using AngularJS, Browserify, Bower, and Twitter Bootstrap (using Scss).
